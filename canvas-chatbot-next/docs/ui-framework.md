# Canvas Chatbot UI Framework

This UI framework standardizes styling, components, and accessibility for the Next.js app. It builds on Tailwind v4 and Radix UI.

- Tailwind v4 utilities and `@theme` CSS variables
- Design tokens and ThemeProvider for light/dark
- Core components (atoms/molecules/organisms)
- Storybook documentation and examples
- WCAG 2.1 compliance via Radix primitives
